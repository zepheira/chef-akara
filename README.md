Description
===========

Installs and configures [Akara](http://akara.info/) as a service.

Requirements
============

* [python](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/python)
* logrotate
* systemd

Tested on:

* Ubuntu 16.04

Attributes
==========

In order to support multiple instances of Akara on one node, data bags are used.  For the recipe, the following attributes apply:

* `node["akara"]["data_bag"]` must be set to the data bag containing the Akara instances to deploy, *required*.
* `node["akara"]["base"]` defaults to "/opt/akara"
* `node["akara"]["user"]` defaults to "akara"
* `node["akara"]["group"]` defaults to "akara"

Each item in the data bag will be known by and set up according to its idenifier.  The data bag items can carry the following attributes:

* `port` defaults to 8880
* `max_servers` defaults to 100
* `max_spare_servers` defaults to 30
* `min_spare_servers` defaults to 10
* `max_requests_per_server` defaults to 1000
* `log_level` defaults to "INFO"
* `pip_options` defaults to nothing, extra options for pip
* `packages` lists extra packages and the version to install in the virtualenv.  The recipe is aware of which are required and will install the latest for those that aren't in the `packages` hash.
* `modules` lists extra modules to include in akara.conf
* `module_config` is a hash with extra configuration directives, like

```
module_config: {
  config_class: { attr1: value,
                  attr2: other_value }
}
```

Usage
=====

Include the `default` recipe to install Akara instances according to the data bags you set up.
